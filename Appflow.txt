Application Flow
----------------

1. User Interaction:
   - User accesses the React web application.
   - Interacts primarily via voice commands.

2. Voice Capture:
   - Frontend captures voice input using the browser's microphone API.
   - Sends the audio data to the backend via an API request.

3. STT Conversion:
   - Backend processes the audio with the configured STT service (ElevenLabs, Cartesia, or Deepgram).
   - Converts the voice input into text.

4. Intent Recognition:
   - Backend analyzes the text using the configured LLM (Gemini or OpenAI) to determine the user's intent (e.g., send email, book call, chat).

5. Action Execution:
   - Send Email:
     - LLM generates email content based on the voice command.
     - Backend sends the content to the frontend.
     - Frontend displays an editable popup with the email content.
     - User edits and confirms the email.
     - Frontend sends the finalized email back to the backend.
     - Backend uses Gmail API to send the email.
   - Book Call:
     - Backend initiates a call using LiveKit.
     - Frontend renders the call interface.
     - Voice interactions during the call are processed with STT and TTS as needed.
   - Chat with Customers:
     - LLM generates a text response to the user's input.
     - Backend converts the response to speech using the configured TTS service.
     - Frontend plays the speech back to the user.

6. Configuration Switching:
   - Update `backend/app/core/config.py` to switch between STT, TTS, or LLM providers (e.g., from ElevenLabs to Deepgram, or Gemini to OpenAI).
